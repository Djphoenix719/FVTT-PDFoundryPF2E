# FVTT-PDFoundryPF2E
Adds [PDFoundry](https://github.com/Djphoenix719/PDFoundry) integration to the Pathfinder 2E player character sheet, as well as to various item sheets throughout the system. This module also exists as an example of how to add PDFoundry integration into a system.


Sources look like this on the item sheet.

![Source Example](https://github.com/Djphoenix719/FVTT-PDFoundryPF2E/blob/master/.github/source-example.png?raw=true)

You can click the word "Sorce" to open the PDF, once you enter a valid source. They must be entered in as `NameOrCode Page`, as shown in the image above. That's the name or code, followed by a space, followed by a page number. Names with spaces are not supported in this very simple setup, use a PDF code in that case.

Quick links are provided on player actor sheets like the following.

#### Spells

#### Items
![Example](https://github.com/Djphoenix719/FVTT-PDFoundryPF2E/blob/master/.github/example-items.png?raw=true)

In all cases the quick click PDF icon will only appear if a source is entered. This is shown in the item example.
