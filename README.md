# FVTT-PDFoundryPF2E
Adds PDFoundry integration to the Pathfinder 2E player character sheet, as well as to various item sheets throughout the system.

Sources look like this on the item sheet. They must be entered in as `NameOrCode Page`. That's the name or code, followed by a space, followed by a page number. Names with spaces are not supported in this very simple setup, use a PDF code if you have a name with sapce.
